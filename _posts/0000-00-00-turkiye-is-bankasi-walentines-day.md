We’ve created an interactive pop-up installation based on real-time heartbeat detection on 14th of February for Valentine’s Day.

Our goal was to promote bank’s touch-id integration for it’s iOS mobile applications. Users were drawn by a space with led illuminated tubes and an iPad screen asking ‘Who your heart beats for?’. When users fill in their and lover’s name, they were asked to place their finger on a heartbeat sensor as an input to refer touch-id action and data transaction through finger.

An animation with full of hearts gets triggered and projected on a huge wall and as they watch the animation, his/her excitement of love calculated with heartbeats in real-time. In the end of the animation their names were on the wall with the calculated heartbeats and cheers!

On the technical side, we’ve used several addressable led’s, few led controllers, a pulse sensor, an Arduino and wireless communication to the computer on the projector side (which was hidden in an apartment flat) with an OpenFrameworks application.
