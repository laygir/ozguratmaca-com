# Hi! My name is Özgür Atmaca
<br>
I am a 31 years old multidisciplinary designer working and living in Istanbul, Turkey. I have 13 years of experience in the creative field, worked with various agencies, architects and clients like Allianz, Avon, Efes Pilsener, Fiat, Garanti Bank, Jeep, Koç Holding, Logitech, Mc Donald’s, Nike, Philips, Samsung, TAV Airports, Turkcell, Türkiye İş Bankası, Unilever, Vodafone and Volkswagen.

Produced creative work in different disciplines from print design to branding, 2d/3d graphics to motion graphics, user interface designs to user experience research and interaction design, photography to video production. For the last 5 years I have been involved much with microcontrollers, electronics and physical production-machining to conduct work in physical user interaction design.

Co-founded and now creative director of Büyük Ayı, a design and creative production studio developing web connected objects, installations and interactivity blended with moving images across major digital channels since 2008.

Irregularly, I give workshops on creative technology to students, agencies and brands while maintaining consultancy and creative work on freelance basis as well.

As a designer, I am highly motivated with technology in manner of tangible tech and software based. I have worked with developers closely for building web based experiences and creative applications thus I know how things are programmed and how to think like a developer, what they need and how some architectures are built. I have technical knowledge in css, html and basic level php and c.

So in most cases within various projects I am a key person who understands the dynamics of the industry, parameters of the target audience and the type of work that needs to be executed; from print to online, digital to physical, shooting to post-production/motion graphics, electronics and such..

I have spent great deal of time in my father’s carpentry atelier in my childhood, I have grown with a maker mind. Caused by this instinct and production experience gained by this time, I have co-founded another retail design brand with my longtime partner Ezgi Çınarlı. “Nice to Have” aims to delicately create functional and quality objects for fine living. So while we enjoy CNC lathe and routers, producing gears and calculating ratios, plastic injections, moulds, metal bending and welding, you may take a look at what we have been up to in our retail and online store.
