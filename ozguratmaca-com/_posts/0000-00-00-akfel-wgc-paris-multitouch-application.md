Around April 2014, we started sketching out various space capsule designs based on the brief coming from the agency. It was for a roadshow that an automotive LPG company called Aygaz Otogaz going for. 

The approach was capturing audience attention on the field with an unexpected object, a space capsule coming from the future with a message in it. The message was composed of three key future projections; Climate Change, Health and Economics in the future. Story focus and our goal were to raise awareness and target emotional, perceptual experience.

On 21st of May, we had the approval of capsule designs, materials, construction plans, key visuals and concept overall. Except we had no storyboard and two months to deliver the thing on the field. To cover up roughly we built a 4 meters long, 2.3 meters wide and 2.2 meters high made of aluminium space capsule looking experience area. 

We planted five LCD TV’s inside, three of them were the main screens which was feed by a multitouch application streaming 3240 x 1920 pixels of data and two of them were on the sides acting as a control panel, status updates and fictional settings. Again on both sides, we had 8 highlighted subjects in seven segment displays. Displaying real-time numbers of deaths today, births today, deaths caused by cancer and deaths caused by the hunger for instance.
