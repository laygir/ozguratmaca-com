Around April 2014, we started sketching out various space capsule designs based on the brief coming from the agency. It was for a roadshow that an automotive LPG company called Aygaz Otogaz going for. 

The approach was capturing audience attention on the field with an unexpected object, a space capsule coming from the future with a message in it. The message was composed of three key future projections; Climate Change, Health and Economics in the future. Story focus and our goal were to raise awareness and target emotional, perceptual experience.

On 21st of May, we had the approval of capsule designs, materials, construction plans, key visuals and concept overall. Except we had no storyboard and two months to deliver the thing on the field. To cover up roughly we built a 4 meters long, 2.3 meters wide and 2.2 meters high made of aluminium space capsule looking experience area. 

We planted five LCD TV’s inside, three of them were the main screens which was feed by a multitouch application streaming 3240 x 1920 pixels of data and two of them were on the sides acting as a control panel, status updates and fictional settings. Again on both sides, we had 8 highlighted subjects in seven segment displays. Displaying real-time numbers of deaths today, births today, deaths caused by cancer and deaths caused by the hunger for instance.

Each topic had 35 to 45 seconds of animation content to narrate the story, at the end of each scene, users faced with an interactive 3d world geometry to go through the details of just explained. For example after the Climate Change scene an interactive scenario opens up to let user browse the drastic escalation of carbon dioxide and nitrogen emission between 1956 to 2056. Throughout the story every crucial detailed data was mined from various articles, reports, future projections and documentaries.

Overall journey actually starts with a push of a button on the back side of the space capsule. When button kicks in an automatic door opens up while sending a signal to an Arduino board which triggers another Arduino board with two real time clocks to light up seven segments. Another signal goes to main PC which runs the multitouch application and video feed to initialize the welcome screen. Third signal going from the main Arduino board to the second PC which runs the side screens. Fourth signal goes to led control panel for lighting the ceiling which is responsive to the current content playing on main screens which makes led control panel synced in realtime to the main pc.

Yes it was a complicated setup and in the end we found our self controlling every bit with a network of Arduino’s talking each other even when logging out from the capsule. There is a button inside which is yellow by the way, when you press that button, automatic doors opens up, system shuts down and CCTV stops operating until the next push from outside.

After 52 days of sleepless nights, lots of calories and chain of events ruled by Murphy we delivered the space capsule on time for the roadshow. It was a huge experience for all of us and full of education on every step of it.
