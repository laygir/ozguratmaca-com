We have shot, produced and directed Fiat interactive new year calendar for three years in a row. Main idea is to invite the target audience to a web site where they do the photoshooting for Fiat’s new year calendar. Each year we shot 12 girls with 4 cars as video and users try snapping the best poses on the web site. In the end first 2013 users finished the whole shooting received their own taken photos printed as a physical calendar in their mailboxes.

Shootings were done in 3 days at studio P Blok. I did everything from creative direction, interface design, post-production to visual direction. Worked with well known fashion photographer Emre Doğru as director and Murat Akay as director of photography.
