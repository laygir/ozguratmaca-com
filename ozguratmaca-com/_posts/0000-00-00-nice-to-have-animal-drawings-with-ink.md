In 2012 i co-founded a brand called “Nice to Have” , “Producing delicately created objects for fine living.”

The first collection was launched in March 2015 with various products; including artworks, tote bags and cushion covers.

Animals and their incredible complexity has always fascinated me. I have been interested in animal stories; their intelligence, skills and culture. Searching for their features, characteristics, survival skills, chasing exclusive species.

The original drawings are made on paper with ink, a perfect way to draw detailed animals. Then each animal drawing posed on silk, and screen printed by hand on high quality fine art paper and canvas fabric.

Every single tag is crafted exclusively from poplar plywood, sanded by hand until it gets smooth enough. Animal stories are engraved on tags with the production date and the weather condition of specific day.
