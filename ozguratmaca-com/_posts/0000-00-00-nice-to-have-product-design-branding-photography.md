In 2012 we co-founded the brand called “Nice to Have”, “producing delicately created objects for fine living”. First collection and online shop was launched in 2015, after a short period of time opened a retail store in İstanbul.

How you feel about an object is important, sometimes we encounter a few that we have to use even we don’t like. We believe that the objects people own in their lives, are small reflections of how they choose to live it or had to..

We appreciate conscious consumption, investing in quality and the idea of owning things for life. Our goal is to create objects that are pleasing to the eye for years to come and durable enough for frequent uses.

Within the aspects of good design and aesthetics, user friendly experience is one of our priority. We produce our products using the best possible material and processing methods with local artisans.

We believe in heritage of knowledge and experiences shape our lives. Learning is the key to keep our imagination alive.

You may take a look at what we have been up to in our retail and online store.
