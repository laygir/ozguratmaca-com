We’ve created an interactive pop-up installation featuring real-time and pre-defined skeleton tracking and matching based on human recognition using Xbox Kinect in February 2015.

Our goal was to create an interactive game to promote bank’s Kinect controlled, console based banking application for Xbox One.

We had a shooting in studio with a choreographer and two performers, creating six different clips featuring various banking figures for three music genres. While doing this we also recorded performers skeleton data in order to match the real-time input generated by a participant in the field.

20 or more banking and dancing figures were targeted for each song and if participant’s were good enough to act exactly or nearly the same, they were motivated with supers associated with banking.

When playing, we took their photos and printed them out like a slip when they are finished.
