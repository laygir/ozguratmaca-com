Hello,

My name is Ezgi Çınarlı, I am a designer and illustrator living in the Netherlands.

Studied Photography and Video in Istanbul Bilgi University with a full scholarship and attended most of the classes from Visual Communication Design department as well. Our education in the university pushed us to involve and gain experience in various parts of the field, which helped me to collaborate with people from different disciplines.

For last 5 years, i was a part of  Büyük Ayı, a design and creative production studio in İstanbul, developing web connected objects, installations and interactivity blended with moving images across major digital channels.

At Büyük Ayı, I’ve considered each work as an opportunity to develop and expand my skills in different areas of design. Played various roles in each project, including design and illustration, concept development, art direction and production, photography and video, re-touch and post production. Collaborated with photographers, directors, motion designers and developers.

In 2012 i co-founded the brand called “Nice to Have”, which produces delicately created objects for fine living.  First collection and online shop was launched in 2015 with a retail store in İstanbul.

You may take a look at what we have been up to in our retail and online store.
